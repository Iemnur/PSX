<br />
PSX Bare Metal Code by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the Armips assembler by Kingcom.<br />

I have included binaries & executables of all the demos.<br />
<br />
Special thanks to the Hitmen demo group, who with their asm sources, helped me get into PSX Coding =D<br />

<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
All the code compiles into a single binary & executable (NAME.EXE) file.<br />
Using Armips Run: make.bat<br />
<br />
Howto Run:<br />
I only test with a real PSX.<br />

You can also use N64 emulators like NO$PSX.
